### General Info

The Argonauts challenge is an educational project requested by The Wild Code School in which the author seeks to demonstrate mastery of the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) by fulfilling the requirement for the implementation place of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) (sometimes called SCRUD with an "S" for Search) which designates the four basic operations for the persistence of data, in particular the storage of information in the database.

The author realizes that this project is far from being finished, nor optimized, in particular in the part concerning the treatment of the server errors. Nevertheless, the application is now fully functional and responsive. Additions and possible modifications, as well as performance tests are planned within the framework of continuous learning as the professional evolution of the author progresses.
